Project Description:

This project implements a large integer calculator using linked lists to handle very large numbers with a large number of digits. The calculator supports arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on arbitrarily large integers. Each integer is represented as a linked list of its digits, and double linked lists are used for some operations that require moving backward through the list.

Solution Overview:

The program is implemented in C and consists of several functions to handle different operations and functionalities:

ReadFromFile: Reads numbers from an input file and stores them in linked lists.
MakeEmpty: Allocates memory for a new linked list and initializes it.
Insert: Inserts a new value into a designated place in a doubly linked list.
PrintLinkedList: Prints the list of numbers stored in the program.
Addition: Performs addition operation on two numbers stored in linked lists.
Subtraction: Performs subtraction operation on two numbers stored in linked lists.
Multiplication: Performs multiplication operation on two numbers stored in linked lists.
Division: Performs division operation on two numbers stored in linked lists.
Operations: Handles user's choice of operation to perform, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Sign: Determines the sign of a number (positive or negative).
Compare: Compares two numbers to determine their relative size.
Usage:

Compile the program.
Create an input file containing at least two numbers.
Run the program.
Choose the operation you want to perform from the menu.
Follow the prompts to select numbers and perform the desired operation.
Results will be printed to an output file.
Note: Ensure that the input file follows the specified format, and the output file will contain the results of the operations performed.
